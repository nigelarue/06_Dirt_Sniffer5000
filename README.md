# 06_Dirt_Sniffer5000
That's no moon, that's a space station! The days of sniffin' the dirt are over. Weather apps these days are in it for the money, not the science. 
The Dirt Sniffer 5000 uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and uses users' `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).
